# Delivery Manager

A Delivery Manager is both responsible and accountable for the delivery of YLD services with the aim to exceed a client’s satisfaction. 

They are responsible for managing one or more agile projects with our clients, typically to deliver a specific product/service via a multi-disciplinary, highly skilled and motivated team. They are adept at delivering complex projects, breaking down barriers for the team and our clients. They are comfortable both planning at a higher level and getting into the detail to make things happen when needed.

They are expected to work on-site during various customer engagements.

The Delivery Manager is incentivised on the quality of the service delivered by YLD.


Here are a number of guidelines in several areas that we would like to see.
