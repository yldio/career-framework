# Framework for career progression

At YLD, we believe that people should be allowed to grow their careers without
feeling the need to leave the company in search for other opportunities and
challenges. We also appreciate that true mastery in a given role or track
requires time and commitment from both sides, which is what you can expect us to
provide.

In order to do so, we created a framework for career progression that aims at
describing what roles we have available in the company and what challenges and
responsibilities come from each of those roles.

Regardless of each role, we do expect every engineer and member of the company
to adhere to the company [values][1], as those
are what makes us unique. The demonstration of those values is what pushes us
forward in the right direction, and also responsible for a positive impression
we leave on our clients and products.

The framework dsescribed here accounts for 2 different contributory roles:
individual contribution and leadership. We are first and foremost a consultancy
organisation, which means most engineers will work with our clients. That said,
there are roles available which focus purely on engineering work with less
client work. That engineering track is possible based on the company’s financial
situation and exists to support the business and push it forward on the
engineering side.

In order to progress in your career, you should use this framework as input for
your [goals settings’][2] meetings, in order to work towards your progression.
Then, during your [appraisals][3], you and your line manager can assess how
you’re progressing towards your goals and if a promotion is justified. When you
reach an agreement and build up a case, HR will validate the promotion and make
it official.

Here is a small table to guide you through the steps:

| Timeline of events |
| ------- |
| Evaluate yourself against the job description for your position and find out where you would like to improve on; or alternatively decide where you want to move into and find out what you are currently lacking. |
| Every quarter, we expect you to set your own goals - use this opportunity to set goals that are aligned with your ambitions, not forgetting the company and team goals as well. Make sure they are measurable, actionable and realistic. |
| Speak with your line manager about your goals and together decide what projects are best suited to help you accomplish your goals. |
| Improve on your goals as you work on projects, keeping in mind your direction.|
| Use your bi-annual appraisal to check your progress against the objectives.  Make sure you have ways to demonstrate how you’re improving and how you’re reaching your goals. |
| Together with your line manager, use the appraisals to discuss your career goals and decide whether you’re ready for it or need further improvements.  Remember, we want to see improvements on behaviours and consistency, not just on-off achievements. |

We don’t expect promotions to happen every six months, but we do review salaries
and benefits frequently. Furthermore, increase in responsibilities can happen at
any time and are project-specific. When you are confident you’re ready to step
up based on the team and your achievements, you should start building up your
case for promotion.

There are a number of [FAQs][4] that aim at addressing the most common questions
about this framework, but please let your line manager know if you have any
other question about it.
